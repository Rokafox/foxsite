                  not just the one previous move, it would be possible to eliminate no-win situations completely.
                  However, it would be difficult to determine and enforce such cases.
                  The example here could be treated as seki, but there are an infinite number of forms of cycles, 
                  not all of them can be treated as seki.
                  The solution would be for the players to consider each case and decide what they think is fair, rather than making absolute rules.
